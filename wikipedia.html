            If you know the name of an article for which you are looking, simply
            type it into Wikipedia's search box.
            If you would like to look around the encyclopedia to see what is on it,
            use Wikipedia's Contents pages. Lists and indices are examples of contents
            for a published work, and Wikipedia has many of each, including a complete
            alphabetical index and indices by category.
            Links to all of Wikipedia's main contents pages are presented below, and
            they in turn link to the more specific pages.</p>
